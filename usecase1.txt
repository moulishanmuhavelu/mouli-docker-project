1) Pull Nginx docker image from hub to VM and run the docker image
    > docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name mouliwebserver nginx

    > docker ps -a 

2) Show its webpage can be viewed
   > curl -v localhost:8080

3) Tag the image with a custom name and show all the images and docker containers running and then delete the container.
   > docker tag 62d49f9bab97 nginx:v_1.0
    62d49f9bab97 is the image id of nginx copied after running the command docker images -a

   > docker stop mouliwebserver
   > docker rmi -f 62d49f9bab97 
     -f -> force delete the images as there will be 2 images with same id since we tagged it.

4) Pull ubuntu docker container image and connect to the container by launching its shell and see the environment variable
   > docker pull ubuntu
       - This will pull the latest ubuntu image from docker hub
   > docker run -it -d --name myubuntu ubuntu
       - This will run the ubuntu image with the given name as myubuntu

   > docker container exec -it myubuntu /bin/bash
        -  Opens the terminal as below:

        > root@626348234:/#env
          - env command will show the environment variables

5) Copy a file from the local file system to the running container.
    > docker cp sample.txt myubuntu:/tmp
      cp - copy command | myubuntu - name of the container
      /tmp - the folder tmp which is inside the container

    > docker container exec -it myubuntu /bin/bash
       > root@626348234:/# cat /tmp/sample.txt

6) Mount a folder from the local file system into a container in read-write mode and modify it from inside the container 
   and then, show the modified file from local file system;
   > docker run -d -it --name myubuntu --mount type=bind,source=c:/Mouli/usecase1,target=/tmp ubuntu
     -- mount -> contains the key-value pair seperated by comma
   > docker container exec -it myubuntu /bin/bash
     -- goto /tmp folder and edit a file and exit the container
     -- cat the file and display the content

7) Delete all the containers and images
   > docker stop myubuntu
   > docker rmi 7e029101910
